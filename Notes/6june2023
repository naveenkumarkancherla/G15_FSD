HTML tags and their attributes  we have covered till now :
	• a  - href -- for hyperlinking 
		○ eg: <a href="https://www.oracle.com target="_blank" > click here to visit Oracle website</a>
		○ try both with absolute urls as above with the protocol and complete web site url 
		○ also try relative url , with respect to the current html page which is getting rendered 
		○ for eg : if u are refering to cart.html from the same folder as of index.html  ,then your link will look like this:
		○ <a href="cart.html">Cart</a>
		○ if it is in a different folder you will have to give a relative path to it 
			§ lets say cart.html is in src2 folder which is a sibling of src folder where index.html resides , so if you want to access cart.html relative url from index.html will look like this
				□ <a href="../src2/cart.html" target="_self">View the cart</a>
		○ similarly you can create hyperlinks on images , on buttons , you can change the protocal to mailto and also link to email address 
	• p - - paragraphs  lorem- vs code  lorem400 
		○ try style and title attribute with this p
	• body background image and background color , try diff options from w3 schools as well
	• any text node of p or h1 try changing text alignment , color ,font family , diff  css properties
	• try out tags fromlink below
