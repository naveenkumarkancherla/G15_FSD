Every programming language has its own syntax and set of rules to be followed while writing programs

What is a variable ?
A container for storing values
It can be primitive :
: number
string
boolean
null
undefined
Symbol
bigint

or an Object
========
eg :
const person = { 
    id:111,
    name:'deepali'
}



Always follow the naming conventions :
letters digits and underscore and $ dollar sign allowed
must begin with a letter or $ symbol or underscore
should not be a keyword
case sensitive



use let instead of var to declare variables
var is globally scoped while let is block scoped

var can be redeclared and  updated in its scope
let can be updated not redeclared

const can neither be updated nor re-declared
